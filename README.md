## Welcome!

Thanks for coming to my Github. Here you will find projects I've done since I was a wee starter engineer, until now. You'll find a variety of front end, back end, full stack code snippets.

I am a full stack developer and I love to discover new technolgoies. My latest obsession: AI and LLMs - currently playing with prompt engineering with OpenAI and other models (Llama, Gemini, Anthropic). 

Please explore! I have a few work in progress projects that I am looking forward to complete. Don't hesitate to ask me about them when we get a chance to connect!

## Technologies
**Front-end:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, NextJS, HTML, CSS, GraphQL, WebSockets, RESTful API, Jest/RTL/Cypress<br/>
**Back-end:** Node, Python, MySQL, MongoDB (NoSQL), AWS EC2/S3/RDS, CI/CD, Netlify
